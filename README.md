# README

This is an adaption of the Wid'op Google Analytics library for use with Yii.

The Yii adaption allows you to add the API as a component which can be used to easily query and return results in a number of different ways. 

The Wid'op Google Analytics library provides a way to use certificate-based authentication in server-to-server
interactions with google analytics. 

In other words, no user interaction will be required thanks to the "PKCS 12" certificate and you will be able to
automate your google analytics authentication and authorization processes as well as the way of querying the
google analytics service.
